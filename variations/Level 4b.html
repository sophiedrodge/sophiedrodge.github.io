  I BELIEVE IN LUNATICS

  <p> I offer a modest solution: Find the cracks in the wall. There are a very few lunatic entrepreneurs who will understand that culture and design are not about fatter wallets, but about creating a future. They will understand that wealth is means, not an end. Under other circumstances they may have turned out to be like you, creative lunatics. Believe me, theyâ€™re there and when you find them, treat them well and use their money to change the world.
