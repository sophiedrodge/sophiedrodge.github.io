			<h1>Time and Space</h1>
			<h2>Cia Rinne - ZAROUM</h2>
			<blockquote>
					<p> time does not <br>
						care about space <br>
						space is scared <br>
						to death because<br>
						of time <br><br><br>

						time can come <br>
						whenever it <br>
						wishes, and change <br>
						the life of space. <br>
						time has no life, <br>
						only through space <br>
						it does continue <br>
						to float <br><br><br>

						space would like <br>
						to stay, for<br>
						some time, but <br>
						time is mercyless, <br>
						and runs faste <br>
						the more space<br>
						 wishes to rest <br><br><br>

						space needs to  <br>
						adapt to time, <br>
						but time is <br>
						indifferent to<br>
						spacial problems <br><br><br>

						time is older <br>
						than everything<br>
						else, and still, <br>
						always the <br>
						youngest of all<br><br><br>

						the age of space<br>
						is counted by <br>
						 time, and while <br>
						 time stays young<br>
						 space grows old <br>
						 time is mercyless <br>
						 space is faithful <br>
